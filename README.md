## 🔄 Asynchronous Programming

- `async` and `await`
- Task-based programming
- `Task.Run()`, `ConfigureAwait(false)`
- Deadlocks and best practices

---

## 🧵 Multithreading & Parallelism

- `Thread`, `ThreadPool`
- `Task`, `Parallel.For`, `PLINQ`
- `lock`, `Monitor`, `Semaphore`, `Mutex`
- Thread-safe collections

---

## 🎯 Delegates, Events, and Func/Action

- What are delegates?
- Multicast delegates and events
- `Action<>`, `Func<>`, `Predicate<>`

---

## 📦 Generics and Constraints

- Generic classes and methods
- `where` constraints
- Covariance and contravariance

---

## 🔧 Reflection and Dynamic Types

- `System.Reflection`
- Dynamically loading assemblies
- Invoking methods dynamically
- ExpandoObject, `dynamic` keyword

---

## 🧠 Expression Trees

- `Expression<>` usage
- Building LINQ providers
- Compiling expression trees

---

## 📌 Attributes and Annotations

- Custom attributes
- Reflection-based access
- Practical use: Logging, validation, etc.

---

## 🧰 Dependency Injection (DI)

- Constructor and property injection
- `IServiceCollection`, `ServiceProvider`
- Scoped, Singleton, and Transient services

---

## 🧱 Design Patterns in C#

- Singleton
- Factory / Abstract Factory
- Strategy, Decorator, Observer
- Repository and Unit of Work

---

## 🗂️ File I/O and Serialization

- Reading/Writing files with `System.IO`
- JSON/XML Serialization (`System.Text.Json`, `Newtonsoft.Json`)
- Binary serialization

---

## 🌐 Working with APIs and HTTPClient

- REST API calls with `HttpClient`
- Handling retries, timeouts
- `IHttpClientFactory` best practices

---

## 🧪 Unit Testing and Mocking

- `xUnit`, `NUnit`, `MSTest`
- Mocking with `Moq`
- Testable architecture

---

## 🚥 LINQ Internals and Performance

- LINQ vs. SQL performance
- Deferred execution
- Custom LINQ providers

---

## 🧩 Interoperability with Native Code

- Calling C/C++ DLLs with `DllImport`
- `Marshal` class
- Unsafe code blocks

---

## 📈 Performance Optimization Tips

- Span<T> and Memory<T>
- ValueTask vs Task
- StringBuilder, pooling, caching
- Benchmarking with `BenchmarkDotNet`
